Navigate to the directory:

cd startsys-react-speech-recognition-v2

## Usage

To start the application in development mode:

npm start

This will start the application and open a new browser tab pointing to 'http://localhost:3000' or another open port if 3000 is being used.

The application provides a simple interface with a microphone icon and a text input field. Click on the microphone icon and start speaking. Your speech will be converted to text and populated in the text input field.

## Deployment

This will create a 'build/' directory with all the compiled files. Your application is now ready for deployment.

## Using the 'startsys-react-speech-recognition' npm Package

[Startsys-react-speech-recognition](https://www.npmjs.com/package/startsys-react-speech-recognition)

This application makes use of the 'startsys-react-speech-recognition' npm package. If you wish to use this package in your own projects, install it via npm:

npm install startsys-react-speech-recognition

Import it in your React component:

import Speech from 'startsys-react-speech-recognition';

And use it in your JSX:

&lt;Speech onSpeech={(text) =&gt; console.log(text)} /&gt;

This will render a microphone icon that, when clicked, starts the speech recognition process. The recognized text can be logged to the console with the line above added to the react component, or the text can be added to an input element as shown in this demo app with the below App.js file.

Please ensure that the users' browser supports the Web Speech API.
